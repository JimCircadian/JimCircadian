Welcome to the personal Github home of James Byrne, Principal Software Engineer at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). 

<!--**JimCircadian/JimCircadian** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I work on tools and systems that underpin environmental Digital Research Infrastructure. This is a very vague way of saying that I do whatever makes the environmental science community positively tick from a technology perspective. Previously I worked for industry in various forms, but that's long behind me... :wink:

Please do read my [professional(ish) profile over at BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/jambyr), my more [community oriented profile over at the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/james-byrne) or [my ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3731-2377) for more research related bits I've been involved with.

I might extend this and other pages soon, but in the meantime it was nice to see you: thanks for dropping by!
